== Projects using NSMNTX

* https://medium.com/@nick.p.doyle[Nick Doyle] writes on using Neo4j to map your AWS Infrastructure and he uses NSMNTX to ingest the RDF produced by http://awless.io/[awless]. Read his post https://medium.com/@nick.p.doyle/using-neo4j-graph-database-to-map-your-aws-infrastructure-a81b1a49981b[here]

* Refinitiv in their https://developers.refinitiv.com/knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph-feed-api/learning?content=48179&type=learning_material_item[developers tutorials section] include a step by step description of how to import one of their public datasets into Neo4j using NSMNTX.

* Tony Hammond created an Elixir wrapper library for NSMNTX. He describes it in https://medium.com/@tonyhammond/graph-to-graph-with-elixir-9cd7fd6f2128[this blog post].

We know there are more out there! If you're using NSMNTX we'd love to hear about what you're doing. Let us know about it at https://community.neo4j.com/[the community forum].You can help us growing this list!





//===== backlog...
//Here are some ideas I'll blog about in a near future (if you don't do it before):

//* Use NSMNTX to visualise in neo4j/Bloom the output of your SPARQL CONSTRUCT query.
//* Enrich your Neo4j model with DBPedia data
